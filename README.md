# DeepLearning_H20_R
Deep learning research using R and free datasets

Where I did a random search using h20 to serach for a sample of parameters and the 
the respective model performance.

Next used a gam to model the performance based on the parameters & results from the leep learning models.

to find optmimal parameters the I used rbayesian optimization on top pf the gam model, not on the results from a new training.


A dataset from kaggle was used from competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/leaf-classification
